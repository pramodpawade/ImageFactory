##Inspec Testing Framework

InSpec is a free and open-source framework for testing and auditing your applications and infrastructure. 
InSpec works by comparing the actual state of your system with the desired state that you express in easy-to-read and easy-to-write InSpec code. 
InSpec detects violations and displays findings in the form of a report, but puts you in control of remediation.

##Standalone usage

In this module , we have created a inspec profile for Ubuntu Operating System as it differs according to the underlying operating sytem flavour.
Here the inspec profile will check the Ubuntu OS configuration parameters with middleware componets and will display the test summary.
Please find the below command to execute the Ubuntu based Inspec validation profile
